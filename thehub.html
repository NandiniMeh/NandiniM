          <h3> 1. Research </h3> <br> <br>
          <h4>Surveys</h4>
          <p>We wanted to gather feedback from the existing users. We set up an online survey and asked them fill it out.</p>
          <img src="./img/survey.png">
          <br>
          <ul>
              <li>A google form was circulated among students</li>
              <li>We received 23 responses</li>
              <li>Students were asked to respond to the following questions:</li>
          <ul>
               <li>Are you open to meeting new people through online communication works?</li>
               <li> How often do you talk to your [School/University] classmates?</li>
               <li>How satisfied are you with the quality of social life at your [School/University]? <br> (1 being not satisfied, 5 being satisfied)</li>
          </ul>
               <li>The following responses were received from a majority of participants:</li>
          <ul>
               <li>Yes</li>
               <li>Sometimes</li>
               <li>70% chose > 3</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Participants were also asked to include a summary of how they felt about <br> attending university/school online. Below are some of the submitted responses:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>“I hate having to do everything on my own”</li>
              <li>“There’s little to no face to face interaction with my peers, so its tough making friends!”</li>
              <li>“Hard to find new things to do with other people nowadays apart from games”</li>
            </ul>
          </ul> <br><br>

          <h4>Personas</h4>
          <p>Based on the survey we set up a persona. We referred to this persona throughout the entire product development process.</p> <br><br>

      <section class="hub-ideating">
          <h3>2. Ideating </h3>
          <p> Based on our findings, we derived the following key hypotheses:
            <ul>
                <li>Students lack of face to face interactions with peers </li>
                <li>Student are struggling in keeping up with schoolwork alone </li>
                <li>Students are unable of making new friends during COVID-19 </li>
        </ul> 
            Thus, we came to the conclusion that students desire a service that enhances meaningful connections and allows them to simulate a more social learning. We developed the following
             impact map during our ideation for key features of our app.</p>

        <h3>3. Sketches </h3>
        <p>We began the design process with low fidelity wireframes. This way, we were able to iterate through many design options quickly.

            We conducted guerrilla testing and iterated on our design for the high fidelity prototype. Our participants gave us great feedback related to system visibility, recognition, and user efficiency.

          <h3> 4. Wireframes and Design</h3>
          <p>At the beginning of the design process, we created wireframes for testing purposes. <br> <br>

            We created two low fidelity wireframe models that we used as a guide for creating 
            a user flow chart and a high fidelity wireframe model. <br>
            <br> We mapped out how a user (Elijah for example) would navigate through our app</p>

                            <p>I learned that building trust in a product doesn't require really fancy gadgets, but just empathy. 
                              I also learnt that students require some level of social interaction to remain motivated. Due to the pandemic, a lot of
                              us have faced a decline in productivity. However, remaining connected can reboot our productivity levels.

                              The app needs more usability testing to be successful. After user testing, our team hopes to start developing the app.
                              We also hope to include more features that may be useful to a user such as a the ability to create groupchats. <br>
